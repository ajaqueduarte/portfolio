            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p>Software Developer based in the vibrant city of Toronto. 
                Fresh out of college, I've honed my skills and expertise in Full Stack development 
                through hands-on experience and a thirst for learning.
                During my time in college, I immersed myself in various web projects, totaling 10 successful endeavors. 
                These projects not only sharpened my technical prowess but also instilled in me a passion for problem-solving and innovation.
                Recently, I've ventured into the realm of Data Analysis, delving into one intriguing project that has sparked my interest in this fascinating field.

                Beyond the confines of coding, you'll often find me indulging in my love for video games or seeking adventure on the rock climbing walls. 
                These hobbies not only provide a much-needed break from the digital world but also fuel my creativity and determination.
                
                I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
                Whether you have a project in mind or simply want to chat about the latest developments in the industry, feel free to reach out—I'd love to hear from you!</p>

                    <li>The project is now envisioned to create a straightforward web-based 
                      Inventory Management System (IMS), pivoting from traditional algorithm-based system. 
                      This adjustment is made to cater to the practical constraints of the project timeline, 
                      available skills, and resources. This document outlines the project's vision, objectives, 
                      scope, and key stakeholders, setting the stage for a profound shift in the way organizations 
                      manage their inventory.

                    <li>Detailed system design, which will be covered in subsequent project documentation.
                      User training programs to ensure efficient utilization of the AI-IIMS.
                      Regular monitoring, maintenance, and continuous improvement of the system's AI models. 
                      Point of Sale (POS) System: IMS will not include POS functionality.
                      Payment module
                      Accounting: Accounting and financial modules are not part of IMS
                      Reconciliation: The system will reconcile actual sales and inventory data to identify discrepancies.
                      Development and implementation of advanced AI algorithms for demand forecasting.
                      Integration of the AI-IIMS with existing inventory management systems and databases.

                    <li>The revised purpose of this Project Vision Document is to present a unified understanding of the web-based IMS among stakeholders, guiding the project's streamlined planning, development, and implementation. This document will base project plans, requirements, and design specifications on established inventory management practices, ensuring:
                      Effective Inventory Control: Utilize proven formulas and algorithms to maintain ideal inventory levels based on historical sales data and delivery patterns.
                      Cost Reduction: Implement strategies to track and reconcile inventory accurately, reducing costs linked to overstocking and minimizing waste.
